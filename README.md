## 🕶 Who Am I?

I’m not your typical university dev.  
I don’t chase tutorials — I reverse engineer what works.  
I build agents that **remember**, tools that **respond**, and systems that **scale**.  

🎓 3rd Year @ KCA University  
🧠 Backend-focused | AI-infused | Automation-native  
📍 Nairobi, Kenya

## 🧠 My Arsenal

```yaml
Languages:      Python, C, JavaScript, Bash
Frameworks:     Django, React, Vite, TailwindCSS
AI Systems:     LangChain, ChromaDB, Groq, OpenAI
Automation:     n8n, Supabase, webhooks, SQLite
State:          Redux Toolkit, Semantic Memory
Infra:          WSL, Git, SSD Workflows, Render
````

> I code like I’m being watched by future versions of myself.
